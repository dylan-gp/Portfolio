## Proposed change as of 2/19
![Proposed Change](./ProposedChange2:19.png)

## Current Concerns
* Lots of business logic in components. Currently in the process of factoring out logic for animations given the weight of the components.  Regarding the other components, given the small scope of the project I don't see the logic being a problem.   If projects expands more it may be a good idea to factor out logic.  Could possibly even use a lightweight store controller like Mobx.
